				As a fan of the Latin culture, Americo started taking dancing lessons in his natal Mexico City. Salsa, Cumbia, Merengue, Banda and Quebradita were his favorites. He also took Tango lessons when he was studying abroad in Sweden. When he was 18, one of his first jobs was as a Party host in a night club in Cancun. Since then he has been exploring different types of dancing and everywhere he goes, he likes to visit clubs and dancing spots.
