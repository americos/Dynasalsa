						<p>Francisco "Paco" Romero began his Latin dancing career while attending Albert Einstein High School.  There he joined a Latin dance group called, Latin American Students United (LASU). Their participation in different Latin dance competitions throughout the state of Maryland enabled them to win many trophies in several Latin dances such as salsa, merengue, bachata, the Show Case, and in the Jack and Jill categories.  In this successful dance group, Paco, of Salvadoran background, stood out amongst his dance peers because of his unique and seasoned style of dancing.  In 2004, Paco had won trophies in all of the divisions of the Annual Latin Dance Competition in Maryland with his designated dance partners. During his last year of high school, he participated in the Washington Post Music and Dance Awards, where he was a finalist.  Additionally, Paco has also performed at Warner Theater in Washington DC., the United States Department of Education, United States Department of Agriculture, and in many Latin festivals in the Washington, DC area.</p>
						
						<p>In college, Paco started his own salsa dance group, which ran for one year.  He then became part of a well-known salsa dance group called, "Son in Motion," where he performed at several venues, including the Washington DC Salsa Congress.  When "Son in Motion" split in 2007, Paco continued performing in different venues with his dance partner. Paco created his own choreographies in salsa, reggaeton, bachata, merengue, cha-cha, and tango and also taught private lessons.  In 2008, he joined Dynamix and has performed in the Las Vegas Salsa Congress, New York Salsa Congress, Washington DC Salsa Congress, and Miami Salsa Congress.</p>
						
						<P><b>Fun Fact:</b> Paco became interested in dancing only after joining his high school group for community service hours.  Had it not been for that, he would not have found his passion for dancing.  He also earned a college scholarship after participating at a symposium for music and dance.  Paco met his fianc&eacute;e, Sylvia, through the team.</p>
