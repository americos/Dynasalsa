<p>Being from a Latin background, Sylvia has been exposed to the Latin rhythm and dances all of her life.  After watching shows with professional salsa performers, she became inspired to learn the techniques of salsa so that one day she could dance to a choreography and do the fun lifts and tricks—not what you learn at home.  Sylvia  began taking salsa lessons in 2008 and quickly joined the student performance group, Salsazon.  After a year, she joined Dynamix in the fall of 2009.  Sylvia has performed at the Las Vegas Salsa Congress, Miami Salsa Congress, and several venues in the Washington, DC area.</p>
<p>Sylvia was born in Washington, DC and has lived in the area her whole life.  She received a B.S. in Family Studies from the University of Maryland in 2006. </p>
<p>Fun Fact:  Sylvia is a belly dancer and performs solo and in a troupe around the Washington, DC area. She met her fiance, Paco, through the team.</p>
